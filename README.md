# BrowserRPG Game Design Document

The Game (Currently unnamed) is to be a browser-based, smaller scale than massively multiplayer, event and player-driven multiplayer Role Playing Game. It is to have a limited number of locations within the overworld, to be traversed easily within a single play session. Any game events will be centered around these discreet locations. I elect to not follow the "season" model that many modern games follow. I choose this to not alienate players who can not or choose not to devote many of their waking hours to a metagame. That is not to say that a meta will not develop, but overall this will be a casual experience. The primary focus will not be how well a player can min/max, but what the player can achieve. 

# Core Gameplay loop

2. Check notifications
